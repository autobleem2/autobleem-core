// play (the theme's, or the user's own file from resources/music) and at which sample rate. Owned by App and
// reached as `app.audio()`.
//
// Not to be confused with `gui->audio()`, the ableem::Audio this sits on: that one is just the mixer device
// (open/close). Everything that knows what a theme or config.ini is lives here.
